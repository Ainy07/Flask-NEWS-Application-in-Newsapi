### NewsAPI: 
- News API is a simple Rest API for retrieving live articles from all over the web. Using News API we can fetch top headlines of a country from a particular source like the Times of India, Hindustan Times, BBC News, and many more. We can also fetch articles related to a particular topic. visit (https://newsapi.org/) for more information.

### API key generation
- In order to use the News API in our application, we need to generate a unique API key from (https://newsapi.org/.) Visit this website and create your free account, on successful registration and email verification you will get your API key on the screen. While registering you may need to choose a developer plan (choose according to your requirements). Save this API key somewhere so that it can be used further.
